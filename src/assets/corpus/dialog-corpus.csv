Sales_Tax_calculation_on_P-Card,"Here are some examples of how sales tax is calculated on the P-Card Reconciliation page:

1. If the P-Card transaction is linked to a PO ID, then the sales tax info from the PO line will carry over to the P-Card transaction. 
2. If the PO ID has multiple PO lines, then the system will also automatically split the summary P-Card transaction into the corresponding PO lines and sales/use tax from the PO lines will carry over to the newly split P-Card transaction lines.
3. If there is no PO ID, then Dept. P-Card Reconciler has to manually split the summary P-Card transaction into multiple lines. The Reconciler will need to include the unit cost of each line plus the sales/use tax amount and enter that amount on each split line. The total split amount must equal 100% of the summary total amount which is the original amount that came from US Bank.

NOTE: Sales/Use Tax that carried over from the PO ID or manually calculated on the P-Card transactions will not flow to the P-Card voucher ID. All P-Card system-generated voucher IDs are created as Tax Exempt.",

The PO line unit price is not editable because the checkboxes for Price can be Changed on Orders were not checked at the contract header and contract line on the associated contract which you copied this PO ID from.

Creation_of_Receipt,"A Receipt ID is required for the following acquisition types: Non-IT Goods, IT Goods, Non-IT Services, and IT Services. SCO will not approve Voucher ID for payment without the associated Receipt ID(s). 
There are numerous reasons why a Receipt ID is required:
1. A Receipt ID is required by SCO
2. A Receipt ID is required for Asset information to interface to Asset Management (AM) 
3. A Voucher ID is created by copying from the PO Receipt ID, in order for asset accounting to interface to Asset Management
NOTE: It is important that the Interface Receipt checkbox is checked when a Receipt ID is created for an Asset. This will ensure that the asset information flow to Asset Management.
